Because auctions now start at their highest price point and move downward - catastrophic losses may occur if the auction were to start significantly below market rates.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While this parameter is designed to combat an Oracle attack, it also offers a further safety net during a legitimate market downturn.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"trade-offs\"\n    }}>{`Trade-offs`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Like many parameters, Governance should avoid setting the Breaker Price Tolerance too far in either extreme.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If set too high this parameter becomes too sensitive, risking breaker shut-offs during normal market movements and adding a risk of collateral continuing to fall while liquidations are prematurely paused. This may result in significant bad debt for the Maker Protocol.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Conversely, setting the Breaker Price Tolerance too low is similar to not having one in the first place. Because the starting price for each auction is based on the OSM price, bad debt can accrue quickly if there is a sharp decline in the OSM price feed combined with a Breaker Price Tolerance that is set too low.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"changes\"\n    }}>{`Changes`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Adjusting the Breaker Price Tolerance parameter is a manual process that requires an executive vote.

That at its most extreme (setting this parameter to 1.0), any price drop would enable the calling of the circuit breaker. The closer the Breaker Price Tolerance parameter is set to one, the more likely it is that the breaker can be called.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Why decrease this parameter?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`If Governance wishes to allow for more price volatility from a particular vault type, a decrease in the Breaker Price Tolerance parameter can be pursued.
