Once you've seen how easy it is to work with our technical community tools, and how they\ninteract with our Developer Experience and Design work, like DAI-UI, we hope you'll fall down the rabbit hole\nand begin to figure out the deeper architectural challenges and intricacies of what \"better money\" might really mean for all of us.`}</p>\n    <Button to=\"https://docs.makerdao.com\" primary mdxType=\"Button\">\n  Protocol Documentation\n    </Button>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
