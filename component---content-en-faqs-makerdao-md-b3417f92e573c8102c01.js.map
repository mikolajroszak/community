The Maker Protocol, the set of smart contracts that make Dai possible, is run by the decentralized governance community of MakerDAO. The Maker Protocol, as one of the largest decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain, was the first decentralized finance (DeFi) application to earn significant adoption. All Dai is backed by a surplus of collateral that has been locked into audited and publicly viewable Ethereum smart contracts.

In the context of MakerDAO, a decentralized governance community manages the Maker Protocol through an embedded governance mechanism. The organization is made up of all MKR token holders, vocal community members, and ecosystem stakeholders. MKR holders have the sole authority to enact changes to the system through on-chain voting. It is decentralized because no single party has full control over the system. It's autonomous in that, once deployed, the Maker Protocol facilitates its own governance through the built-in governance mechanism and the existence of MKR.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"who-is-the-maker-community\"\n    }}>{`Who is the Maker Community?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The Maker Community is the wide world of people and organizations that use or support Dai.
