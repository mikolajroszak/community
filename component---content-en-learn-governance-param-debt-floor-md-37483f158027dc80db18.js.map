Keepers may be reluctant to liquidate smaller vaults because the reward is low in comparison to the gas costs of liquidation and bidding in the subsequent auction. This is a problem because the Maker Protocol relies on prompt liquidations to prevent the accrual of bad debt.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"trade-offs\"\n    }}>{`Trade-offs`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Increasing the Debt Floor limits the minimum size of vaults such that Keepers can profitably liquidate vaults where the collateralization ratio has dropped beneath the liquidation ratio.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, increasing the Debt Floor harms vault usage. Setting the Debt Floor too high can exclude users with less capital from using Maker Vaults completely.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Additionally, the higher the Debt Floor is set, the harder it becomes to test the vault functionality of the Maker Protocol without risking significant capital. `}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"changes\"\n    }}>{`Changes`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Adjusting the Debt Floor parameter for a specific vault type is a manual process that requires an executive vote.
